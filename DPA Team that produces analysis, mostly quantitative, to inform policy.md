DPA: Team that produces analysis, mostly quantitative, to inform policy. Within this team, we have specialists in demography, census data, social policy and crime. My role is to introduce new data sources and make data more available around the GLA. This involves producing tools, such as shiny apps, the dashboard I'll talk about in more detail later and other analysis to encourage more data to be used and understood in the decision-making process.

The GLA runs a recovery board that brings together leaders from London's government, business, civil society, police etc that oversee the long-term recovery from the pandemic. 



Our team have started a project to monitor the data for this process and have produced a dashboard that brings together data to one place. 



[demo]

- landing page
- different outcomes/aims
- pages
- plotly - flexdashboard - R
- We like to use open source software, rather than Power BI, Tableau etc. If fits with the skill set we have in the unit

The aim now is:

* to improve and develop the dashboard
* Make the code more robust. 
* Improve managing the data in the back end
* automating processes to collect, process and check the accuracy of the data
